Text Prediction Application
===========================

Introduction
============
Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the usage of electronic devices for email, social networking and other activities. Errors typing on such devices are far from uncommon, and can have considerable implications concerning the efficient use of such devices for communication. 

Text prediction requires estimation of the next character or word given a string of the input history. This may represent a useful solution to the problem of mistyping words. 

In this project we aim to develop a text predictive algorithm derived from large data sets composed of different source material blogs, twitter etc. to develop an application. 


Task 1 - Data acquisition and cleaning
======================================
Data was obtained from HC corpora (www.corpora.heliohost.org). It contains data from four languages (english, german, finish and russian) of blogs, news and twitter data. 


**Tasks to accomplish:**

The aim of this initial report is to perform an exploratory analysis of text data from HC corpora, providing a basic understanding of; 
 - The distribution of words
 - The relationship between the words 
 - The differences in frequencies of words 
 - The presents of word pairs and triplets in the data.

This aim required the accomplishment of three primary tasks:
 - Exploratory analysis. 
 
 - Data cleaning 

 - Profanity filtering - removing profanity and other words you do not want to predict.
